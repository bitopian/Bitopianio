Satoshi Nakamoto is the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, so it’s logical to assume that he must himself own tons of this cryptocurrency, making him the richest man in the world.

Many people wonder how many Bitcoins does he own, and several had tried to make the calculations and have got some impressive numbers, however, we don’t know if this is true or not, as well as we don’t know where he or them are right now since it’s presumed that there are probably two or more persons behind that name.

## The beginning of Bitcoin

Previous researchers had estimated that Satoshi Nakamoto owned a million coins in 2009, but the recent investigations have unraveled that the amount is 700,000 mined that year.

This analysis was made by BitMex based on a previous attempt of knowing how much could have a single miner generated at the beginning of this cryptocurrency.

Of course, this analysis is far from perfect, but it provides an idea of how much is the fortune owned by Satoshi Nakamoto, and it shows us that they may own 1 Million Bitcoins.

According to the findings, in 2009 there are clear indications that there was a dominant miner, and the researchers claim that it could have been this mysterious creator of Bitcoin. Although they also say that the keys may be lost or discarded by now, but it’s not certain.

## Satoshi Nakamoto’s fortune

Based on the number of Bitcoins mined in 2009 by that miner, it’s difficult to determine how many coins Satoshi owns currently, although it is known that they participated in the platform until 2010, which could mean that they could have reached the 1 million Bitcoins.

Since that date, there hasn’t been any sign of Satoshi; so many people have decided to make the calculations to know how much their fortune worth in case if they decide to resurface.

If Satoshi owns 1 Million Bitcoins and considering that the current price of this cryptocurrency is USD$7.7k, his fortune would be the impressive number of USD$7.7 billion as of today.

This means that Satoshi owns 1 of every 21 Bitcoins that are on existence, which is something remarkable.

## The richest man on Earth

If a person or a group of persons own that much Bitcoins, it could mean that if they decided to flood the market it would tank the price of this cryptocurrency, which would be something incredibly bad for all the miners out there.

But this won’t likely occur since there is no point in sinking your creation, so the identity of this mysterious creator probably continues being an unknown for everybody.

Considering Satoshi’s fortune, and if Bitcoin ever becomes a global currency and if it reaches a high peak of worth, then he would become the richest man on Earth, surpassing even the world’s richest nations.

This is a mystery that surrounds the Bitcoin world, and the main question is what would Satoshi do with his fortune and will he decide to show up eventually?
